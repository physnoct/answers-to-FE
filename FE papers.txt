"The observant reader will notice that the aircraft equations of motion were calculated assuming a flat Earth and that we here assume the development frame was the NorthEast-Down frame. This implies necessarily that earth rotation and the variation of the gravity vector with position over the earth were ignored in developing the aircraft equations of motion."

Following the first citation: 

"This simplification limits our mathematical model to the flight of aircraft only.  The model will not properly handle the flight of sub-orbital craft and spacecraft such as intercontinental ballistic missiles, satellites, or the space shuttle.  The model is adequate for all vehicles traveling under Mach 3. 
For trajectory propagation, since we cannot assume a flat Earth, the original inertial reference frame, denoted with an ‘i’ subscript, is modified for the elliptic Earth. Thus, we align our newly defined ‘surface’ frame, with the inertial frame ‘i’. The surface frame then moves with the aircraft so as to provide a frame that is tangent to the Earth’s surface for interfacing with trajectory propagation equations, and parallel to the aircraft’s horizontal plane of flight for interfacing with the aircraft's flat-Earth dynamics. All velocities that were originally defined with respect to the ‘i’ frame, are now taken to be with respect to the ‘s’ frame."

In other words, they used the elliptic earth for their models, as we can see in the figures.
