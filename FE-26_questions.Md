FE Questions
============
1. On a globe, the circumference of the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn are equal, but, on a flat earth, the tropic of Capricorn would be 70% longer. What makes the sun slow down from December to June then speed up from June to December year after year? In other words, why are days longer in the summer and shorter in the winter?  
2. What keeps the sun and moon in a circular motion above a stationary flat earth?  
3. What causes the solar analemma?

4. If you can see both the sun and moon during a selenelion eclipse, and they are at their maximum separation, why can't you see them all the time on a flat earth?  
5. How can the earth's shadow fall on the moon at all (for a lunar eclipse) when the sun and moon are both 3000 miles above the flat earth?  
6. How come the sun and moon disappear from view for hours at a time if they are 3000 miles above the flat earth? Or how do the sun and moon disappear behind the horizon on a flat earth?  
7. If the Sun or moon leaves my perspective, why can I see the stars behind or above them?  
8. What causes the phases of the moon?  
9. What causes the tides?  
10. What causes some planets to show a retrograde motion at times? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK9ozJYELR8  
11. How do the other observable planets disappear and reappear on a regular basis if the flat Earth is not moving?  
12. Why are there two fixed stars (Polaris and Sigma Octantis) with a Coriolis Effect? Notice the clockwise motion in the southern hemisphere and the counter clockwise motion in the northern hemisphere, and why are the stars the same in the three southern continents?

13. Why can't everyone on the flat earth see the same stars all the time?  
14. Why do the stars in the flat earth model firmament dome always move horizontally anti-clockwise over the whole earth?

16. What about the curve?

17. What causes the aurora borealis and aurora australis, and why can't everyone see them?  
18. Can you explain the ice wall during the Cretaceous period when the polar ice caps did not exist?

24. What about tectonic plates, earthquakes, and volcanoes (especially calderas) on a flat earth because no flat earther seems to know what is beneath the surface?  
25. What about the 'firmament' and 'the four corners of the earth'?
