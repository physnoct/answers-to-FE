Answers to FE arguments -- Réponses aux arguments platistes  
https://github.com/physnoct/answers-to-FE/blob/master/FE-MOAB.Md  

No research would be complete without checking the arguments for the globe earth and against the flat earth.  
If you seek the truth you should be ready to follow the evidences, not your beliefs, no matter what!  

The flat earth doctrine has been thoroughly and completely debunked, demolished and proved false beyond any shadow of any doubt, by many different methods and many non-conflicting observations. If it was a dead horse, it would have been beated to atoms.

Flat Earth problems

5 Things Flat Earthers Can't Explain!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9YGG5crp0w

Hints FE is a cult
==================
Hint 1, you have to _believe_ in an enormous conspiracy, just to disprove the pictures of earth we have from space. If just one of these pictures is true, the whole flat earth falls down.  
Hint 2, there is no working flat earth models, no working flat earth map, no picture of a flat earth showing the edge of the earth.  
Hint 3, the Antarctica unaccessibility doctrine is convenient to prevent FEers to check for themselves if there's really an edge.  

What if ...
===========
Let's suppose that a world wide government is established as a New World Order, such that anyone believing in a flat earth would be sentenced to life in prison.
How sure of their arguments flat earthers would be? Who would dare to challenge the basis of their "beliefs"?
Who would verify every flat earther claims to be absolutely sure it's true beyond the shadow of a doubt?
Would they check opposing arguments to see potential problems and come up with corrected answers?

Researching Flat Earth - Where are the Flat Earth Pilots? Lets talk.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhgEUHYagLk

Flat earthers' lack of scientific background vs globe earthers indoctrination
=============================================================================
Many if not all flat earth arguments are based on some misunderstanding of maths, physics, or a poor knowledge of the currently accepted science.

One thing is certain, many if not all flat earthers lack a solid background of maths and physics which shows in their arguments.
This is not an insult, this is an obvious observation. When asked for doing some maths, few of them can actually answer. It's understandable that some get angry or get offuscated when asked for their credentials.

It's understandable that for many reasons, a higher formation isn't required for their daily tasks. But when discussing science such as the flat earth model vs the globe earth, this become a weak point for them, and the scientific knowledge is _essential_ to discuss these matters.

When flat earthers want to discuss physic principle, what do they have? They only have their day to day experiences, the more or less clearly defined basic concepts such as speed, acceleration, weight, force and maybe more.
Maybe they learned something in school! They may not all agree on the validity of maths, for example, considering calculus as made by free masons. So there is no consensus about the basics among the flat earthers.
Another crucial aspect is the lack of numbers. Without numbers, it's easy to largely underestimate or overestimate a quantity, leading to false arguments, such as the earth spin flinging water into space.

What we globers learn at school is not indoctrination, since the material is based on well established science, based itself on scientific observations, and the physic principles are verified by students doing experiments.

Flat earthers can familiarize themselves easily with maths and physics. There are many videos on YouTube where they can learn the same stuff teached at schools and universities (for free!).
Learning from books is a bit harder, since the reader need to make an effort to visualise the concepts. Visualising a concept is much easier with animations.

To convince flat earthers, we must show them some basic physics that they can see and experience everyday.

Basic physics
=============
No curvature
------------
Flaw: generalization from cherry picked observations

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6ICUh6pxmA  
Many of the flat earth claims of no curvature are based on cherry picked observations made in particular conditions. They are used to generalize from it, while the usual observations show a globe. So, all the "see too far", "flat water" claims can't be relied on.

Earth spinning,wobbling
-----------------------
Flaw: failure to grasp acceleration, rotation and speed. Also no sense of scale.

The FE claims commonly mentions the earth spinning at 1000 mph. This is not a rotation speed. This 1000 mph figure is the tangential speed at the equator. This number comes from the circumference at the equator divided by a day (or 24h). The circumference, rounded at 24000 miles, divided by 24 hours gives a speed of 1000 miles per hour (mph).
A rotation speed is expressed in the number of cycles per unit of time, for example: 3600 RPM, which means 3600 revolutions per minute. The earth itself, rotates around its axis with a speed of 1 turn per day = 360°/24 hours = 15°/h = 72.7µrad/s

Flat earthers also mention all the other movements of the earth aound the sun, itself orbiting around the center of the galaxy, itself going through some direction in the universe. It's understandable that flat earthers deny this, because we don't feel these movement.  
https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2018/08/30/our-motion-through-space-isnt-a-vortex-but-something-far-more-interesting/#4ed154227ec2  

All those movements have 2 parts: a constant speed which we can't feel, and a "turning" part that we could feel if it's fast enough. These 2 parts are independant. It's the same principle as a moving train.
Why can't we feel a constant speed? It's because of the 2nd law of Newton. F = ma. A constant speed is 0 acceleration, so the force is 0. No force, no disturbance.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy60E3I_K94

If the train was moving on a very large curve, the "turning part" would be slow. But on a small radius, it would be much faster: the passengers would be throwed to the side by the centrifugal force.  

The earth's movements also change direction, but too slowly to be percepted. All the movements are confirmed by astronomical measurements.  

The fastest rotation rate is once per day (72.7µrad/s), which is very slow. The gravity is about 300 times stronger than the resulting centrifugal acceleration (33.7mm/s²). The yearly rotation is 365.25 times slower, giving a centrifugal acceleration of 5.9mm/s² so the gravity would be 1600 times stronger.  

Hurtling through space at 67,000 Mph - what does that look like?  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nQqOBPH8bM  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mCISBTcSFY&feature=youtu.be&t=21

Some flat earth videos seem to make the argument that the earth's orbiting motions in many simultaneous directions is impossible or absurd. Quite the contrary. We can see examples of simultaneous movements in our daily lives (some rides in an amusement park).  
Many simultaneous movements  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJkZLPOBIJI

Earth's orbit
-------------
Flaw: missing some basis of trigonometry

In order to keep up and pass it (circle it) Earth must speed up to pass, and then slow down once it's passed (circled)."  
That's the acceleration component along one axis. There is also another component of this acceleration along a perpendicular axis: once it's passed the sun (in one side) it accelerates and slow down to get to the other side. These 2 components combine into a circle, or a vector that's oriented towards the center of the orbit. You can see clearly the principle here:  
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_cos_sin.gif

Water flung in space
--------------------
Flaw: no numbers, so the claim exagerates the effect

At the equator, the gravity is about 291 times greater than the centrifugal acceleration, so water doesn't fly into space.

Earth model
-----------
The earth can be modelised with a sphere small enough for experiments. Both gravity and centrifugal accelerations are dependent on the radius of the sphere, while the ratio gravity/cent. acc. is independent of the radius. With any sphere at earth's density, the maximum speed of rotation is about 17 revolutions per day.﻿

Hollow earth

Pressure and vacuum side by side
--------------------------------
Flaw: misunderstanding of pressure and vacuum

(À la Kent Hovind) Vacuum doesn't suck because there's no vacuum cleaner in space. Since there is nothing in space, why would it suck?

The atmospheric pressure gets lower with altitude. It becomes almost nil at about 40km. There is no need then for a physical barrier, since both side of it has 0 pressure.  
That also explains why satellites in low earth orbit don't use balloons: balloons can't climb over 40km.

There can be regions of high pressure next to low pressure, as we can see in meteorology. These cause precipitations (rain) and wind.

The vacuum barrier argument may be a misconception. A perfect vacuum is by definition 0 _absolute_ pressure (0 psi, 0 N/m², 0 bar, 0 atm, etc.). Normally on earth, we make a vacuum by tying a vacuum pump to some container. This vacuum pump has a negative pressure: it sucks the air. Thus, the image "a vacuum pump sucks" remains "attached" to the idea of vacuum.  

Pressure is defined as force/area (N/m²). Vacuum is defined as null pressure (P = 0 N/m²) so no force against an area, so vacuum doesn't suck.

Is the suction of a 1e-17 torr vacuum 100 000 000 000 times stronger than a 1e-6 torr vacuum?  
No. The "suction" depends on the pressure difference, not the pressure ratio.

If you take a vessel at 1 atmosphere (14.7 psi or 760 torr) in the vacuum, you'll get a pressure differencial of:  
At 1e-6 torr (high vacuum), we have 760 - 0.000001 torr           = 759.999999 torr  
At 1e-17 torr (ultra-high), we have 760 - 0.0000 0000 0000 0000 1 = 759.9999 9999 9999 9999 torr  
At perfect vacuum,          we have 760 - 0                       = 760 torr.  
So, no matter how high the vacuum is, the difference stays about the same.  

Selective gravity
-----------------
Flaw: possible confusion between mass and weight

(À la Kent Hovind) Birds don't weigh an ocean, an ocean doesn't weigh a butterfly.

Everything is attracted with the same acceleration (9.8m/s²), not the same force (weight).  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyeF-_QPSbk

so the gravity isn't selective. The resulting force depends on the mass of the attracted object (F = ma), making gravity "selective".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun

The midnight sun should be visible above the arctic circle, not just at the pole.

During the summer soltice, on the arctic circle, at midnight, the angle of the sun is 0° above the horizon, making it possible to see the sun. At local noon, the sun is 47° (2 x 23.5°) above the horizon.  
Any point above the arctic circle would be able to see the sun during all day. There would be obstruction only when the observer is below the arctic circle: the sun would be below the horizon.

Cameras don't have the same range of sensitivity as our eyes. While we're able to see indoors without problems, any camera will need slower shutter speeds to be able to see something. To see the stars at night, your camera will need long exposure time.
During the day you won't be able to see the star while photographing a bright subject. If you overexpose the image, stars will appear, but subject will be blurred.

Globe earth
-----------
Observations by different methods, confirming the globe

From Walter Bislin:
[There are] hundreds of thousands geometric measurements that show the earth is a globe, that show Kansas is not flat, that show that the circumference of Antarctica is factors smaller than what the flat earth tells, that show the Bonneville Salt Flats are curved with a radius of about 6400 km...

Plot of the 3D locations of all UNAVCO reference stations. Each location is measured from the distance to many satellites with known positions to sub mm accuracy. If the earth were flat, all points would lie on a plane. The coordinates of the locations are listed in the table at the bottom. They are used as references for high precision GPS measurements in many scientific fields.

Space is water  
The waters above that the bible was refering to, are merely the water within clouds. It's a reasonable interpretation, it explains the verses very well and goes along with modern science.

If there was water above, why didn't god put fishes in it? Also, turbulances in water above would behave the same as below. We would see the light affected by this, but it's not what we observe.

If the sun was above the water in space, all the red light would have been absorbed, as shown in these video:

In the comment section:
"Si on observe le film complet de Phil POLLACIA (voir ta référence), on  constate qu'il a gardé les amorces des bobines et on peut donc mesurer la durée de la bobine incriminée (bobine de l'envol de la fusée): l'amorce blanche démarre à 1:00.44 et la fin de la bobine est à 1:03.59. En prenant l’hypothèse que le marqueur de temps du report VHS est correct, cela fait 195 secondes (3mn15s). En prenant l'hypothèse que le report s'est fait à 18 images/seconde alors que le tournage en S8 était en 24 images/s, cela fait 3510 images (195 x 18), ce qui était en fait en temps réel lors du tournage 146s  (3510/24). 146 secondes, c'est 2mn26s soit la durée approximative (à quelques secondes près) d'une bobine de 15m en super8 (bobine standard de ce format). La conclusion est donc que le film en super 8 a été très certainement fait à 24 images/s, mais le report en VHS a été fait (par erreur sans doute) à 18 images/s, ce qui "ralentit" l'envol de la fusée."

NASA paper admitting non rotating flat earth  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAlSOI5uHkc&feature=youtu.be&t=1m39s

The paper only assume this for a simulation. It doesn't state this as truth.  
A flat earth is also a good approximation of a globe earth for a small area (say, a circle of 25km).

NASA documents talking about a flat non-rotating earth (FNRE) are no more than simplifying assumptions. In many case, the effect studied doesn't need to take into account the curvature of the earth, for example, aerodynamics of wings. Also, normal flight conditions will exceed easily the weak stress induced by a rotating globe.
Some papers "assume" a FNRE explicitly, others don't. In no case, however, this should not be considered as proof, since it's used for calculation. As FEers agree, calculations are not "proof" by themselves.

Another paper by NASA make a statement of fact about the shape of the earth:  
https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19860010309  
It clearly says: "A strategy is presented along with background material for determining downward atmospheric radiation at the Earth's surface on a regional scale but over the entire globe "﻿

Snipers
-------
"do snipers take the Coriolis effect into consideration before shooting?"  
Not for short distances. The sniper manual doesn't seem to mention Coriolis corrections.  
http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/MILITARY/united_states_army_fm_23-10%20-%2017_august_1994.pdf

However, in another document, they mention the rotation of the earth as a factor for firing corrections.  
"Met corrections are all measurable non standard conditions for which you can account.  
These are the effects of weather, propellant temperature, projectile weight, MVV, VI,
and rotation of the earth (...) ."  
https://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/mcwp3_16_4.pdf  
See chapter 11, table 11.1, step 3﻿

Senses
======

"Problem is, our senses suck. How many times have you been stopped at a light and the car beside you starts to roll back slightly and you for a moment panic and think it's you moving? Or on a train at a stop and the other train starts to pull away slowly and you swear you feel like it's you moving, for a second. Our senses suck." tommy605  

"Use your senses." Use your intelligence also. Our senses have limitations and can be tricked. Even in the bible, you weight objects for commercial purposes with a balance scale (2 weights, 2 measures). Instruments can measure more precisely than our senses, and it provides experimental data.

Even in the bible, they relied on balance scale to weight object. This means the bible recognize that our senses are not always adequate for measuring, thus the use of instruments of measure for volume, lengths and weights.

Our senses may not be precise enough depending on what you're observing. Let's take an example. Machinist must make a flat surface within thousandth of an inch.  
You simply can't tell it's flat within that resolution.

https://io9.gizmodo.com/5926643/10-fundamental-limits-to-human-perception----and-how-they-shape-your-world

Ideally, for better results, you can use several methods for observing the same phenomena. Since many centuries, scientists developed many instruments and improved their accuracy.

For those religious, another example comes from the bible: god given senses are not enough since the bible talks about two weights, two measures, thus the use of an instrument: a balance scale.  
There is also the concept of measurements in the bible: weights, lengths, time, and maybe others, which need instruments to be accurate.
Amos 7:8

Maths

Stars not moving
----------------
Earth and the solar system travel in space at 514000 mph through the galaxy.
This speed is enormous at our human scale: common sense would say that at such speed, we should see the stars moving. Why not?
Common sense also says that if an object is far enough, it won't move much.
A common example is a car going on a highway at 100 km/h. We can see that objects farther away move slower.

Some astronomical measurements:
Alpha centauri distance km: 4.132e12 km  
Earth orbit diameter km: 149.6e6 km

Galactic speed of the sun  
514,000 mph  

Expressed in other units:  
828,000 km/h  
230 km/s  
143 mi/s  
0.000000087435 light-years/h  
0.0007664 light-years/year

Polaris never moves
-------------------
Polaris does move a little during the night since it's not exactly in line with the earth's axis.
There is also a movement of precession which makes the earth wobble with a period of about 25000 years.

But with the galactic speed of the sun, should we see Polaris moving too?

Polaris is at about 433 light-years from earth.

Let's convert the 514000 mph speed in astronomical scale.

During a year, the solar system would travel a distance of 4505627779 miles.  
   514000 mph * 24 h/day * 365.2422 days = 4505627779 miles.  

Let's approximate that to 4500000000 miles (4.5e9).

Converting that distance into light-years, we have 0.0007655 ly  
So, in a year, Polaris would have moved by an angle of about  
   0.0007655/433 ~ 0.00000177 radian or 0.0001 degree,  
which would be unnoticeable.  

Note: at very small angles, the sine of an angle and the angle itself are approximately equal.

﻿Flat earth model

Water sticking to a globe model  
https://physnoct.wordpress.com/2019/12/21/earth-model-with-water-sticking-to-it/

On the Flat Earth, How High is the Sun?  
http://www.nmsr.org/flatter4.htm

How do we calculate the distance from the north pole to any latitude on a flat earth model?  
1) we straigthen the curvature of the globe earth. The distance from the north pole to the south pole is half a circumference.  
Thus, distance NS = π * radius.  
2) The latitude is a fraction of this distance: (90°- lat)/180.  
The latitude varies between the maximum at -90° (S90°), and the minimum at +90° (N90°).  
At the north pole, we have (90° - (+90°))/180° = 0°/180° = 0.  
At the south pole, we have (90° - (-90°))/180° = 180°/180° = 1.  
The distance from the north pole to a point of given latitude is:  
distance = π * radius * (90°- lat)/180°.  
The circumference of that distance would be 2π * distance = 2π² * radius * (90°- lat)/180°  
Longitude goes from +180° eastward to -180° westward

Here are the formulas for Microsoft Excel (also work in Open Office)  
Substitute the cell location for radius and latitude  
A1: radius  
A2: latitude  
B2: circumference in FE model  
C2: circumference in GE model  

B2 = 2*POW(PI();2)*A1*(90-A2)/180  
C2 = 2*PI()*A1*COS(A2*PI()/180)  

For the circumference on a globe model (assuming a perfect sphere)  
2π cos latitude  

Spherical coordinates on the globe (assuming a sphere)  
𝜚 = R+h  
𝜙 = (π/180°)long = [-π,+π]  
𝜗 = π(90°- lat)/180° = [0,+π]  

Cylindrical coordinates on an AE map are: (r,𝜙,z) = (πR(90°- lat)/180°,(π/180°)long,h)  
r = R𝜗  
𝜙 = 𝜙  
z = 𝜚 - R = h  

∂(r,𝜙,z)/∂(𝜚,𝜙,𝜗) =  
(0,0,R)  
(0,1,0)  
(1,0,0)  

det ∂(r,𝜙,z)/∂(𝜚,𝜙,𝜗) = -R

The Racetrack outer and inner boundaries are located on latitude 45° South and latitude 60° South making the Racetrack 900 nautical miles wide.

On a flat earth, the circumference at 45° and 60° South is 94000 km and 105000 km respectively.  
On a globe earth, it would be 28000 km and 20000 km respectively

"Konyukhov came through it all unscathed, returning to King George Sound at 02: 56:50 UTC (10:56:50 WST) to record a time of 102 days 00 hours 56 minutes 50secs for this 16,400 mile circuit of Antarctica." 26400 km in metric, thus proving a globe earth.

In the globe earth model,  
S45 latitude would give a circle of 2π * 6371km * cos 45°= 28300km = 17600 miles  
S60 latitude would give a circle of 2π * 6371km * cos 60°= 20000km = 12400 miles

In the flat earth model,  
S45 latitude would give a circle of 2π² * 6371km * (180°-45°)/180° = 94308km = 58600 miles  
S60 latitude would give a circle of 2π² * 6371km * (180°-30°)/180° = 105000km = 65000 miles

Antarctica cup ocean race

http://www.acronautic.com/antartica-cup-ocean-race/  
Les limites extérieures et intérieures du circuit sont situées à 45° de latitude sud et à 60° de latitude sud, ce qui fait 900 milles de large.

Sur une terre plate, la circonférence à 45° et 60° Sud est de 94000 km et 105000 km respectivement.  
Sur un globe terrestre, ce serait 28 000 km et 20000 km respectivement.

"Konyukhov a traversé tout indemne, retournant à King George Sound à 02: 56: 50 UTC (10:56:50 WST) pour enregistrer un temps de 102 jours 00 heures 56 minutes 50 secondes pour ce circuit de 16 400 miles de l'Antarctique." 26400 km en métrique, prouvant ainsi un globe terrestre.﻿

Oblate spheroid

Curvature
---------
The curvature can be demonstrated to our senses simply by measuring the angle from eye level to the horizon.  
For a person standing at sea level, the horizon is about 0.04 degrees below eye level. By looking from a higher point of view, this angle will increase.  
The value of this angle is arccos(R/(R+h)) where R is earth's radius and h is the height of the observer's eye.

Plane dip
---------
To follow the curvature, the plane simply fly at constant altitude. To fly in a straight line into space, the plane has to climb up. If a plane travels around the earth at 500 mph, it will take 50h to make a full turn (500mph * 50h = 25000 miles) so it will dip its nose by 360° in 50h = 7.2°/h = 0.12°/m = 0.002°/s.  
While the plane flies, the earth itself curves with a bit slower rate.  
The plane's real speed would be: GS/R = PS/(R+h) -> PS = GS*(R+h)/R.

LOS microwave communications
-----------------------------
LOS microwave communications would be possible over the curvature if there are 2 towers. Here are the calculations.  
d (A1) is the distance between the towers,  
R (A2) is the radius of the earth.  
This formula gives the height of the towers needed.  
h = √(R²+d²/4)-R  
Excel formula: =ROOT((A2*A2+A1*A1)/4) - A2  

For 235 km, the 2 towers should have a height of 1km above sea level. Quite achievable if high locations are available.
It's not surprizing then, to see antennas to top of buildings.

g measurement
-------------
g is the value of the acceleration in free fall at ground level, and its value is measurable. To measure it, drop an object from a known height and measure the falling time. It should be independent of the mass. The corresponding value of g is calculated from height and time.  
The relation is h = 0.5 g t²  
Solving for g  
g = 2h/t
