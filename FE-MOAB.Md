The flat earth requires the sun to circle above the earth in order to have time zones. Yet, the sun makes an arc around the earth, not a circle above it. We see the sun set, sun rise which should be impossible on a flat earth. Once the sun is "below" the earth, it's night everywhere on a flat earth. This simulation shows what a flat earth and the sun orbiting above it, would look like.

No research would be complete without checking the arguments for the globe earth and against the flat earth.
If you seek the truth you should be ready to follow the evidences, not your beliefs, no matter what!

Flat earth vs. globe earth isn't recent.  
GE has been established as fact since long ago. Maybe for good reasons. First and most obvious,

1:08 Yet another inexplicable thing on a flat earth.  
1:16 I had the courage to erase all my videos on the flat earth when I understood all its impossibilities.  
1:23 Those who are owners of FE channels; Shame on you for keeping monetising these stupidities.  
1:30 You're speaking of truth seekers? Let me laugh! You're making money by taking people for imbeciles.

Basic physics
=============
Earth spinning,wobbling
-----------------------
All those movements have a constant speed which we can't feel. It's the same principle as a moving train.
The earth's movements also change direction, but too slowly to be percepted. All the movements are confirmed by astronomical measurements.

The fastest rotation rate is once per day (72.7µrad/s), which is very slow. The gravity is about 300 times stronger than the resulting centrifugal acceleration (33.7mm/s²). The yearly rotation is 365.25 times slower, giving a centrifugal acceleration of 5.9mm/s² so the gravity would be 1600 times stronger.

Earth's orbit
-------------
In order to keep up and pass it (circle it) Earth must speed up to pass, and then slow down once it's passed (circled)." 
That's the acceleration component along one axis. There is also another component of this acceleration along a perpendicular axis: once it's passed the sun (in one side) it accelerates and slow down to get to the other side. These 2 components combine into a circle, or a vector that's oriented towards the center of the orbit. You can see clearly the principle here:  
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Circle_cos_sin.gif

Water flung in space
--------------------
At the equator, the gravity is about 291 times greater than the centrifugal acceleration, so water doesn't fly into space.

Earth model
-----------
The earth can be modelised with a sphere small enough for experiments. Both gravity and centrifugal accelerations are dependent on the radius of the sphere, while the ratio gravity/cent. acc. is independent of the radius. With any sphere at earth's density, the maximum speed of rotation is about 17 revolutions per day.﻿

Hollow earth
------------
https://www.metabunk.org/why-do-some-satellites-show-a-hole-at-the-poles-hollow-earth-inclined-orbit.t8109/

Pressure and vacuum side by side
--------------------------------
(À la Kent Hovind) There's no vacuum cleaner in space: vacuum doesn't suck.

The atmospheric pressure gets lower with altitude. It becomes almost nil at about 40km. There is no need then for a physical barrier, since both side of it has 0 pressure.
That also explain why satellites in low earth orbit don't use balloons: balloons can't climb over 40km.  

There can be regions of high pressure next to low pressure, as we can see in meteorology. These cause precipitations (rain) and wind.  

The vacuum barrier argument may be a misconception. A perfect vacuum is by definition 0 pressure (0 psi, 0 N/m², 0 bar, 0 atm, etc.). Normally on earth, we make a vacuum by tying a vacuum pump to some container. This vacuum pump has a negative pressure: it sucks the air. Thus, the image "a vacuum pump sucks" remains "attached" to the idea of vacuum.  

Pressure is defined as force/area (N/m²). Vacuum is defined as null pressure (P = 0 N/m²) so no force against an area, so vacuum doesn't suck.  

Selective gravity
-----------------
(À la Kent Hovind) Birds don't weight an ocean, an ocean doen't weight a butterfly.

Everything is attracted with the same acceleration (9.8m/s²), not the same force (weight).   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyeF-_QPSbk  

so the gravity isn't selective.
The resulting force depends on the mass of the attracted object (F = ma), making gravity "selective".

Astronomy
---------
The stars in the northern hemisphere rotate in an anti-clockwise direction yet in the Southern Hemisphere they rotate in a clockwise direction.
The sun rises due east and sets due west on the equinox.

No stars in pictures
--------------------
Cameras doesn't have the same range of sensitivity as our eyes. While we're able to see indoors without problems, any camera will need slower
shutter speeds to be able to see something. To see the stars at night, your camera will need long exposure time.
During the day you won't be able to see the star while photographing a bright subject. If you overexpose the image, stars will appear, but subject will be blurred.

NASA paper admitting non rotating flat earth  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAlSOI5uHkc&feature=youtu.be&t=1m39s  

The paper only assume this for a simulation. It doesn't state this as truth.  
A flat earth is also a good approximation of a globe earth for a small area (say, a circle of 25km).  

NASA documents talking about a flat non-rotating earth (FNRE) are no more than simplifying assumptions. In many case, the effect studied doesn't need to take into account the curvature of the earth, for example, aerodynamics of wings. Also, normal flight conditions will exceed easily the weak stress induced by a rotating globe.  

Another paper by NASA make a statement of fact about the shape of the earth:  
https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19860010309  
It clearly says: "A strategy is presented along with background material for determining downward atmospheric radiation at the Earth's surface on a regional scale but over the entire globe "﻿

Snipers

"do snipers take the Coriolis effect into consideration before shooting?"  
Not for short distances. The sniper manual doesn't seem to mention Coriolis corrections.  
http://pdf.textfiles.com/manuals/MILITARY/united_states_army_fm_23-10%20-%2017_august_1994.pdf  

However, in another document, they mention the rotation of the earth as a factor for firing corrections.  
"Met corrections are all measurable non standard conditions for which you can account.
These are the effects of weather, propellant temperature, projectile weight, MVV, VI, 
and rotation of the earth (...) ."

Senses
======

"Problem is, our senses suck. How many times have you been stopped at a light and the car beside you starts to roll back slightly and you for a moment panic and think it's you moving? Or on a train at a stop and the other train starts to pull away slowly and you swear you feel like it's you moving, for a second. Our senses suck." tommy605  

"Use your senses." Use your intelligence also. Our senses have limitations and can be tricked. Even in the bible, you weight objects for commercial purposes with a balance scale (2 weights, 2 measures). Instruments can measure more precisely than our senses, and it provides experimental data.  

Even in the bible, they relied on balance scale to weight object. This means the bible recognize that our senses are not always adequate for measuring, thus the use of instruments of measure for volume, lengths and weights.  

Our senses may not be precise enough depending on what you're observing.
Let's take an example. Machinist must make a flat surface within thousandth of an inch.
You simply can't tell it's flat within that resolution.  

https://io9.gizmodo.com/5926643/10-fundamental-limits-to-human-perception----and-how-they-shape-your-world  

Ideally, for better results, you can use several methods for observing the same phenomena. Since many centuries, scientists developed many instruments and improved their accuracy.  

For those religious, another example comes from the bible: god given senses are not enough since the bible talks about two weights, two measures, thus the use of an instrument: a balance scale.  
There is also the concept of measurements in the bible: weights, lengths, time, and maybe others, which need instruments to be accurate.

Galactic speed of the sun  
828,000 km/h (230 km/s) or 514,000 mph (143 mi/s) = 0.000000087435 light-years/h = 0.0007664 light-years/year  

Flat earth model
----------------
How do we calculate the distance from the north pole to any latitude on a flat earth model?  
1) we straigthen the curvature of the globe earth. The distance from the north pole to the south pole is half a circumference.  
Thus, distance NS = 𝜋 * radius.  
2) The latitude is a fraction of this distance: (90°- lat)/180.  
The latitude varies between the maximum at -90° (S90°), and the minimum at +90° (N90°).  
At the north pole, we have (90° - (+90°))/180° = 0°/180° = 0.  
At the south pole, we have (90° - (-90°))/180° = 180°/180° = 1.  
The distance from the north pole to a point of given latitude is:  
distance = 𝜋 * radius * (90°- lat)/180°.  
The circumference of that distance would be 2𝜋 * distance = 2𝜋² * radius * (90°- lat)/180°  
Longitude goes from +180° eastward to -180° westward  

Here are the formulas for Microsoft Excel (also work in Open Office)  
Substitute the cell location for radius and latitude  
A1: radius  
A2: latitude  
B2: circumference in FE model  
C2: circumference in GE model  

B2 = 2*POW(PI();2)*A1*(90-A2)/180  
C2 = 2*PI()*A1*COS(A2*PI()/180)  

For the circumference on a globe model (assuming a perfect sphere)  
2𝜋 cos latitude  

Spherical coordinates on the globe (assuming a sphere)  
𝜚 = R+h  
𝜙 = (𝜋/180°)long = [-𝜋,+𝜋]  
𝜗 = 𝜋(90°- lat)/180° = [0,+𝜋]  

Cylindrical coordinates on an AE map are: (r,𝜙,z) = (𝜋R(90°- lat)/180°,(𝜋/180°)long,h)  
r = R𝜗  
𝜙 = 𝜙  
z = 𝜚 - R = h  

∂(r,𝜙,z)/∂(𝜚,𝜙,𝜗) = (0,0,R)
					(0,1,0)  
					(1,0,0)  

det ∂(r,𝜙,z)/∂(𝜚,𝜙,𝜗) = -R

The Racetrack outer and inner boundaries are located on latitude 45° South and latitude 60° South making the Racetrack 900 nautical miles wide.  

On a flat earth, the circumference at 45° and 60° South is 94000 km and 105000 km respectively.  
On a globe earth, it would be 28000 km and 20000 km respectively  

"Konyukhov came through it all unscathed, returning to King George Sound at 02: 56:50 UTC (10:56:50 WST) to record a time of 102 days 00 hours 56 minutes 50secs for this 16,400 mile circuit of Antarctica." 26400 km in metric, thus proving a globe earth.

In the globe earth model,   
S45 latitude would give a circle of 2𝜋 * 6371km * cos 45°= 28300km = 17600 miles  
S60 latitude would give a circle of 2𝜋 * 6371km * cos 60°= 20000km = 12400 miles  

In the flat earth model,  
S45 latitude would give a circle of 2𝜋² * 6371km * (180°-45°)/180° = 94308km = 58600 miles  
S60 latitude would give a circle of 2𝜋² * 6371km * (180°-30°)/180° = 105000km = 65000 miles

Les limites extérieures et intérieures du circuit sont situées à 45° de latitude sud et à 60° de latitude sud, ce qui fait 900 milles de large. 

Sur une terre plate, la circonférence à 45° et 60° Sud est de 94000 km et 105000 km respectivement.  
Sur un globe terrestre, ce serait 28 000 km et 20000 km respectivement  

"Konyukhov a traversé tout indemne, retournant à King George Sound à 02: 56: 50 UTC (10:56:50 WST) pour enregistrer un temps de 102 jours 00 heures 56 minutes 50 secondes pour ce circuit de 16 400 miles de l'Antarctique." 26400 km en métrique, prouvant ainsi un globe terrestre.﻿

Curvature
---------
The curvature can be demonstrated to our senses simply by measuring the angle from eye level to the horizon.
For a person standing at sea level, the horizon is about 0.04 degrees below eye level. By looking from a higher point of view, this angle will increase.  
The value of this angle is arccos(R/(R+h)) where R is earth's radius and h is the height of the observer's eye.  

Plane dip
---------
To follow the curvature, the plane simply fly at constant altitude. To fly in a straight line into space, the plane has to climb up.
If a plane travels around the earth at 500 mph, it will take 50h to make a full turn (500mph * 50h = 25000 miles) so it will dip its nose by 360° in 50h = 7.2°/h = 0.12°/m = 0.002°/s.  
While the plane flies, the earth itself curves with a bit slower rate.  
The plane's real speed would be: GS/R = PS/(R+h) -> PS = GS*(R+h)/R.  

LOS microwave communications
-----------------------------
LOS microwave communications would be possible over the curvature if there are 2 towers. Here are the calculations.  
d (A1) is the distance between the towers,  
R (A2) is the radius of the earth.  
This formula gives the height of the towers needed.  
h = √(R²+d²/4)-R  
Excel formula: =ROOT((A2*A2+A1*A1)/4) - A2  

For 235 km, the 2 towers should have a height of 1km above sea level. Quite achievable if high locations are available.
It's not surprizing then, to see antennas to top of buildings.  

g measurement
-------------
g is the value of the acceleration in free fall at ground level, and its value is measurable. 
To measure it, drop an object from a known height and measure the falling time. It should be independent of the mass. The corresponding value of g is calculated from height and time.  
The relation is h = 0.5 g t²  
Solving for g  
g = 2h/t²
