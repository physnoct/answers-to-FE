Just observations that anybody can make anytime, with  
no maths,  
no complicated science,  
no money,  
no equipment,  
no high altitude balloon,  
no need to travel anywhere.ï»¿  

We know there are time zones: the time at New york is not the same as Tokyo. Those who travel are aware of this.  
Let's consider the apparent movement of the sun on a observer on earth.  

In order to have timezones on a flat earth, the sun must circle above the earth. Here what it would look like:

The sun size would change during the day, and we would see the sun going on an ellipse in the sky.  

If the sun was going around the flat earth, it would be under the flat earth at night, thus night would be everywhere.  
So, the sun can't go around a flat earth, it should go above the flat earth.  

If we observe the sun and the size doesn't change, and if it doesn't go on an ellipse, then the sun doesn't go above but around the earth.  
If the sun goes around the earth, the earth can't be flat.  

We can see the sun size during cloudy days, when the sun is visible through the clouds. It's about the same size as the sun setting.  
A solar filter confirm this. The sun size doesn't change during the day. At the equinox, we can clearly see the sun going due east to due west.  
During the day and night, the crescent of the moon indicates the position of the sun, indicating it's "under" the earth during the night.  

Thus, the sun circles around the earth, disproving a flat earth.
